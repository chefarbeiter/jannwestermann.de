## Build site
Buildings means compiling of sass to css, conact and minify css, concat and minify js and minify html. This is done with gulp:

```
npm install
gulp
```

The build-script was created with [project local-minifier](https://github.com/amardeeprai/local-minifier) as basis. Thanks to Amardeep Rai!
